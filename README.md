# FruitCatcher
I made this game in about a week in Processing made in Java. It was a one man project that I had to do in one of my college semesters. It was a
lot of fun to make. The process was stressful and I had a lot of hurdles that I had to make(specifically had to rewrite the code that one time,
but for a beginner, I did pretty well. I wasn't really finished because I had to make the sprite for the tongue and I also had to animate the rabbit, but
the concept is what matters to me.
# About
This is a game about a rabbit catching fruit with its elongated tongue. It is a simple game where you get points by catching fruits in a diagonal
position. The trick is that the only way to catch them is to touch the fruit with the tip of your tongue. The fruit is also an obstacle, falling at a 
random speed to get you. If you miss one of the apples, part of the floor disappears, making your movement limited. If you touch one of the 
apples with your head, you fall and you lose.
